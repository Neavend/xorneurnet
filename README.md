# xorneurnet

## Rewritten entirely...

@neavend: I decided to rewrite this code to make it clearer, and I also added A LOT of comments.
It is still not very flexible, and you're likely to want to make some modifications in order to use it,
but this might help you understand the basics of a neural network !

## ORIGINAL README:

This is a simple, ugly neural network with absolutely no
flexibility at all, written to understand the core principles
of neural networks.

Feel free to have a look/contribute if you want to.
